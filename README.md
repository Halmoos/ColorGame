# ColorGame
A simple game using Tkinter library.

# The rules:
1- There are 3 colors: Red, Green, and Blue. From which one will be chosen at random when you press Start.
2- There are 3 buttons to click on. Each button shows a number and a color 
3- You must choose the button with the matching color to the color Label as well as the highest number ranging from 1 to 100.
4- Pressing a correct button will give 10 points, whereas an incorrect choice will take away 5 points.

# Note:
The color that you must choose does no update along with the clickable buttons.
If you want it to do so though -which makes the game more difficult-. There are two lines that you need to uncomment in the game_main function.
And two other lines that you need to comment or remove (just above the game_main function).
